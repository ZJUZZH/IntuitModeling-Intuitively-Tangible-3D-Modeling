**IntuitModeling** is a tangible 3D modeling system designed to help novices and non-expert users create complex 3D models with ease and intuition. This project addresses key challenges in the human-computer interaction (HCI) field, enabling users to intuitively design intricate models with minimal learning curve.

## Overview

IntuitModeling combines flexible, deformable interaction components with a network of embedded IMU sensors, allowing real-time digital reconstruction of physical shapes into 3D models. Users manipulate these components by hand, naturally creating complex surface structures and basic geometric forms, which the system captures and translates directly into digital form. 

### Key Features

- **Flexible, Self-Shape-Sensing Components**: Our modeling system uses a set of deformable components in basic geometric forms, each embedded with IMU sensors to track and reconstruct shape changes in real-time.
- **Intuitive Interaction**: Users create diverse and intricate surface structures simply by manipulating the components, making complex modeling accessible and intuitive.
- **Customizable Design Pipeline**: IntuitModeling includes a design pipeline supporting rapid customization of deformable components with self-sensing capabilities in different shapes.

### Benefits

Through hands-on manipulation, users can generate various 3D forms without extensive training, making it ideal for those new to 3D modeling or without expert knowledge in CAD software. Our user studies indicate that IntuitModeling significantly simplifies complex modeling tasks, allowing for quicker, more intuitive results.

### Getting Started

- Explore the flexible components and experiment with shaping and deforming them.
- Watch the real-time transformation of physical changes into digital 3D models.
- Use the custom design pipeline to experiment with new forms and designs.
